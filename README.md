# Save-A-Screen

Screen savers main purpose was to help old CRT monitors from having an image burnt straight into the screen. 
However, even though these monitors are barely used anymore (thankfully), windows continues with its good ol' habit of supporting old stuff, enabling the support for screen savers in Windows 11 and Windows 10. 
This made me think, why not still utilize it but in a more fun way. And by fun i just mean a simple way of dazzlin' it up a bit, and "saving" a screen by making it more fun. 

This simple script enables the native windows "C:\Windows\System32\ssText3d.scr" executable file to used as the screen saver and continously queries for programmig jokes that are displayed on the screen. 
Constants may be altered at the top of the script for customization, such as for when the screen saver will be triggered, preferred font colors, font size, etc.
